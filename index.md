## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Arizona since August 2023. I received my PhD from University of Missouri-Columbia in May 2023, under the supervision of [Dan Edidin](https://math.missouri.edu/people/faculty/edidin).

## Research Interests

- **Algebraic Geometry:** Moduli of curves, Hurwitz spaces, and their Chow rings
- **Toric Geometry:** Weak Fano toric varieties, Toric quotients

## Recent Activities

- **[July. 2025]** 2025 Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry
- **[May. 2025]** The 2025 AWM Research Symposium, University of Wisconsin-Madison
